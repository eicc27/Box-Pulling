***This file is aimed at helping you guys understand how the game will be played, by LISTING KEYBOARD CONFIGURATION.
***Therefore it has not been designed to be able to be overwritten in the .cpp program.
*It will be displayed in the command line inside the game, and chensihan_20302010003 has the copyright.
**The configuration is UNMODIFIABLE for now (maybe forever), so please STRICTLY FOLLOW THE RULES if you guys want a SMOOTH GAMING EXPERIENCE.
***Even though some naughty guys wanna ignore my warning above, this TEDIOUS program still has a sort of self-defending mechanic to guide you back to rail, but don't expect that too much.
