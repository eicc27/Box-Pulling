# 2. Some unsolved problems (not bugs) due to great difficulty to realize, or my restricted energy

## **if these things are solved other day, they will be marked with '//'.*

## 2.1 Clean the map before next move, making the interface cleaner than before

## //2.2 Dynamic file path

## //2.3 Hook records with user names

## //2.4 a regret function

## 2.5 Ultimately make the whole program run on an independent window, not a dos

# 3. Something you must know before, while, or after running the program

## 3.1 Plz at least roughly read the original code.

### 3.1.1 Manipulate the code if possible or if needed, with the annotations in my code.

## 3.2 When you find a bug, report it to my github page, or just feel free to pull request.

## 3.3 The .vscode file in my file pack is somewhat useless under other IDEs. They are basic .jsons linking my vscode IDE to mingw compilers. But if you use a vscode without configuring a proper compiler (but make sure you have the C++ extensions and mingw installation), these .jsons are extremely helpful!

## 3.4 The whole program is developed using uniform code GB 18030. Mind this out if you don't want to cause troubles while running.

## 3.5 The program is maintained and uploaded through git and github.

# 4. Some best wishes and gratitudes

## 4.1 I feel obliged to thank my kind TAs, and teacher Mr. Chan, giving me clear instructions and useful hints.

## 4.2 Wish you guys have a good game, and a good day!
